            <remarks>Since <see cref="T:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.SandcastleProject" /> already wraps the MSBuild project, it seemed
            redundant to define each and every property on this task and map them to the project properties.  As
            such, this task will attempt to use the executing project to create the Sandcastle project instance.
            If that fails or <see cref="P:SandcastleBuilder.MSBuild.BuildHelp.AlwaysLoadProject" /> is true, this file will be loaded instead.  The
            downside is that property overrides on the command line will be ignored.</remarks>

            <remarks>When you run MSBuild.exe, it does not store the projects in the global project collection.
            We could build the project without it but we lose the ability to use command line overrides and
            changes to user-defined properties.  As such we need to resort to reflection to get the current
